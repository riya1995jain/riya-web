                        <p>In the process to learn designing, I went with solving a  task of designing a mobile application for finding rental rooms and flats. Few days after I started working on the task, I got into a situation where I had to shift to a new city and find a new place for myself.This was the time when I myself experienced the pain points of finding a room in a new city.

                                <h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
                                <p>One of the major problem I faced, while looking for a room was that I never knew anything about the person I was going to share the room with. I also discovered that there were a lot many people who were tenants and posted an ad for a room/flat (basically looking for a roommate/flatmate).
                                So, I decided to create an application which not only helps people find rental rooms/flats but also helps them find roommates of their choice.</p>
                            <h3>Goals</h3>
                            <p>
                                    To create a mobile application which not only helps people find rental rooms/flats but also helps them find roommates of their choice in an easy, efficient and stressless manner.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Target Users</h3>
                                    <p>My target users are going to be the students of age 16-23 and woking youth of age between 23-35. Students and working professionals often move to new city for studies or Job. In a new city they want a help in finding a place to live, roomsey will deliver that help.</p>
                                <h3>Understanding the task</h3>
                                <p>The usual flow of such applications is that the user signs up/logs in , select a location  and start browsing for the properties, after that they contact the owner and proceed accordingly.</p>
                                <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 30px;">People involved </h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Owners (post ad’s of properties, looking for a tenant)</li>
                                    <li>Tenants ( post ad’s of properties, looking for a roommate/flatmate)</li>
                                    <li>Seekers ( looking for a room and a roommate/flatmate)</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The platform that I am going to design is exclusively for the seekers. It will be a platform where owners, tenants and seekers will interact.</p>
                                <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 30px;">Types  of seekers </h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Looking for a room.</li>
                                    <li>Looking for a room and also a roommate/flatmate.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 30px;">Attributes of the seekers</h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Mostly young ( age group 18-32 yrs)</li>
                                    <li>Many are new to the city</li>
                                    <li>One time user or lets say the amount of time spent on the app will be a week or maximum a month</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 30px;">Assumption</h5>                       
                                <p>There already exists an application called Post which helps owners and tenants to post advertisements of the properties.</p>
                                <p>Roomsey will be created in collaboration with Post thus, information will be circulation between both applications.</p>
                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p>To go further my own experiences and understand what are roomseekers expectations and frustations. I had conversation with 10 of my friends who were all living away from their home and have been through the process of finding a room and a roommate.</p>

                                        <blockquote>One of the major problem I faced, while looking for a room was that I never knew anything about the person I was going to share the room with. I also discovered that there were a lot many people who were tenants and posted an ad for a room/flat (basically looking for a roommate/flatmate).

                                        <blockquote>The option to directly call the owner was also not fruitful because they ask you to text them on whatsapp because on call they lose record of who called them and on whatsapp the user have a problem of recalling the owner.</blockquote>
                                                <blockquote>Most of the applications do not inform about the places near the locality, people said that they have to research about the locality after choosing them through the application or have to visit and see.
                                                    </blockquote>
                                                        <blockquote>My roommate did not keep the house clean /was very careless/we never talked. There were compatibility issues with my roommate.So I had to leave the place and had to look for a new flat.This was time consuming and frustating.</blockquote>
                                        <h3>General findings</h3>
                                        <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 30px;">People involved </h5>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>People new to the city could not decide on which area they want to shift to, all they know is that they want a place somewhere near to their workplace.</li>
                                            <li>
                                                    People do not look for room/flat in just one area, they want choices in areas. 
                                                    </li>
                                            <li>I looked at many similar applications like nestaway, flatmates, airbnb, spareroom, no broker and magicbricks. I used these applications and there were certain feautures which were frustating for the user , I made sure not to include those feautures or find a better way to include them in roomsy. Also, I observed the elements and feautures which made a positive difference and have tried implementing them in roomsey.</li>
                                        </ol>
